   During my time of the apprentice I worked at the Publicis Pixelpark GmbH in the frontend and backend teams. 
   There me and a colleague worked together on the following projects. We started by creating a REST API with 
   the Spring Framework in Java. For this REST API we added a web application in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For 
   the development we used an existing internal framework based on Node.js, Express.js und Handlebars. To work 
   together efficiently we committed and pushed our code to GitLab.
   For my final thesis I created a command line application which was used by our data team for automated 
   transfer of social listening data. The data was pulled from a REST API and sent to a streaming service 
   called _Alooma_. From there Alooma was pushing the data to Amazon Redshift.
   The OSZ IMT (which is a College of Further Education) mainly teached us about software development and the 
   basics of programming. There I completed the following two certificates 
   _Microsoft Technology Associate: Database Administration Fundamentals_ and 
   _Microsoft Technology Associate: Software Development Fundamentals_.

   At the FH Aachen I studied ICT with specifics in application development. There I learned a bit about 
   everything - basically how the PC works and also the internet. We had seminars about databases, networks, 
   programming, algorithms, etc. I also completed two certificates there:
   _FH Aachen IT Academy Zertifikat: Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator_ and 
   _FH Aachen IT Academy Zertifikat: Angriffe auf Webseiten - SQL Injection_
   But after six semesters and not really that much of progess in exams I decided to cancel. I really learned 
   a lot during this time and I do not regret any decision about it.
