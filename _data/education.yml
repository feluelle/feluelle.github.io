#    At the FH Aachen I studied ICT with specifics in application development. I..
#    * learnt the basics of programming in C++
#    * learnt about algorithms and data structures
#    * learnt about it security and forensic

#    There I learned a bit about 
#    everything - basically how the PC works and also the internet. We had seminars about databases, networks, 
#    programming, algorithms, etc. I also completed two certificates there:
#    _FH Aachen IT Academy Zertifikat: Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator_ and 
#    _FH Aachen IT Academy Zertifikat: Angriffe auf Webseiten - SQL Injection_
#    But after six semesters and not really that much of progess in exams I decided to cancel. I really learned 
#    a lot during this time and I do not regret any decision about it.
