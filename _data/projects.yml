    "Enforce Best Practices for all your Airflow DAGs. ⭐" - Felix Uellendall
  description: |
    A personal project to enforce best practices for all your Airflow DAGs. Airflint lints your Airflow DAGs
    and reformats them to be compliant with Airflow Best Practices. ⭐️
    It contains rules to reformat your DAGs, like use the new task decorator instead of PythonOperator or even
    detect if jinja syntax can be used instead of calling Variable.get() which makes Airflow much more performant and stable.

    "Auto-generated Diagrams from Airflow DAGs. 🔮 🪄" - Felix Uellendall
  description: |
    A personal project to auto-generate diagrams based on Apache Airflow DAGs. Airflow DAGs specify workflows which
    consists of tasks which can depend on eachother. Based of these tasks and dependencies a Diagram will be generated.
    A Diagram visualises the provider (often cloud-based) used in the Airflow DAGs by simply displaying its logos.

    In search for a solution for the management of data pipelines I stumbled upon the Open-Source
    project Apache Airflow in January 2018. I really appreciate the simplicity of use, high coverage of
    use cases and the community behind it. That's why I decided to give something back so I started
    contributing and am now a committer of this project.
