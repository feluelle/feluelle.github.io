    In search for a solution for the management of data pipelines I stumbled upon the Open-Source 
    project Apache Airflow in January 2018. I really appreciate the simplicity of use, high coverage of 
    use cases and the community behind it. That's why I decided to give something back so I started 
    contributing and am now a committer of this project.

    "Auto-generated Diagrams from Airflow DAGs." - Felix Uellendall
  description: |
    A personal project to auto-generate diagrams based on Apache Airflow DAGs. Airflow DAGs specify workflows which
    consists of tasks which can depend on eachother. Based of these tasks and dependencies a Diagram will be generated.
    A Diagram visualises the provider (often cloud-based) used in the Airflow DAGs by simply displaying its logos.
