    In search for a solution for the management of data pipelines I stumbled upon the Open-Source 
    project Apache Airflow in January 2018. I really appreciate the simplicity of use, high coverage of 
    use cases and the community behind it. That's why I decided to give something back so I started 
    contributing and am now a committer of this project.
