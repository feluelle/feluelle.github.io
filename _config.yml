  I love creating things, solving puzzles, thinking about code and what can be improved.
  Open Source is what I like doing the most. I want to build things that people enjoy working with.
  I also fell in love with the nature üçÉ and the silence being out there.
  I like hiking üåÑ, going out and drinking beer üçª with friends,
  playing the piano üéπ and I am fascinated by the universe üåå.
