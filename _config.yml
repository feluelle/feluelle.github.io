  I love creating things, solving puzzles, thinking about code and improving challenging problems.
  Open Source is what I like doing the most. I enjoy working in the community and sharing my knowledge with each other.

  I also fell in love with the nature and the silence being out there.
  I like hiking, playing the piano and I am fascinated by the universe.
