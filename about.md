## Me

Hey, I am glad you came here. 😊

My name is Felix Uellendall, I am 26 years old and currently working as a Data Engineer at
Digitas Pixelpark in Berlin, Germany.
I joined the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) in September 2019.
Since then I am an [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) Committer.

I love creating things, solving puzzles, thinking about code and what can be improved.
Open Source is what I like doing the most. I want to build things that people enjoy working with.
I also fell in love with the nature 🍃 and the silence being out there.
I like hiking 🌄, going out and drinking beer 🍻 with friends,
playing the piano 🎹 and am fascinated by the universe 🌌.
