Hey, I am glad you came here. :blush:

My name is Felix Uellendall, I am 25 years old and currently working as a Data Engineer at Publicis Pixelpark GmbH in Berlin, Germany.

I love creating things, solving puzzles, thinking about code and what can be improved. Open Source is what I like doing the most. I want to build things that people enjoy working with.
